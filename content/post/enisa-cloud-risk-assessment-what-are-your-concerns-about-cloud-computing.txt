<p>Now’s your chance to express them…</p>
<p><a href='http://www.enisa.europa.eu/'>ENISA</a> (the European Network and Information Security Agency) is conducting a security risk assessment of cloud computing.</p>
<p>If ENISA is unfamiliar to you, here’s how they describe themselves:</p>
<blockquote/>
<ul>
<li>Is a <strong>Centre of Expertise </strong> for the EU Member States and EU Institutions in Network and Information Security, giving expert advice and recommendations</li>
<li>Is a switchboard of information  for best practices</li>
<li>Facilitates contacts between the EU-institutions, the Members States and the private business &amp; industry actors</li>
</ul>
<p>For the Cloud Risk Assessment, the group (of which I’m a member) will focus on three scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>A user perspective on Cloud Computing (i.e. Small and Medium Enterprises)</li>
<li>Cloud Computing in a eGovernment environment (i.e. national health service)</li>
<li>Cloud Computing and Resilience</li>
</ol>
<p>In pursuit of the first scenario, ENISA is seeking feedback:</p>
<blockquote><p>“…aimed at giving advice to (among others) SME’s on the most important risks in adopting cloud computing technologies, as well as ways to address those risks.</p>
<p>As part of this study, we want to look in detail at the perspective of SME end-users of cloud computing infrastructures and applications (either current users or those considering adoption). As a first step, we have decided to base our study on a survey of the actual needs, requirements and expectations for cloud computing infrastructures.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Take the 10 minute survey <a href='http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=CZdVubBa9LIzYlR3KNeZIQ_3d_3d'>here</a> (results will be shared).</p>
