Few things inspire a blogger to write blog posts than appealing to their ego and sense of humour.  Despite concerted appearances to the contrary, it appears I too am susceptible.

Here we take a lesson in marketing brilliance from Novell...as they "take the drama out of Cloud Computing"...by bringing a "slightly surreal blog post":http://cloudsecurity.org/blog/2010/01/25/are-you-trying-to-pin-the-tail-on-the-cloud-donkey.html I wrote to the small stage/screen:

p=. <object width="400" height="225"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=11686394&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=11686394&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="225"></embed></object>

Thanks to the actors for giving me a laugh out loud moment - commanding performances gents! :)

Cheers,
Craig
