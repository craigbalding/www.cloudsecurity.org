<p>I received an email today from Amazon Web Services (AWS) Support announcing new support offerings.  One item that caught my attention is the new <a href='http://status.aws.amazon.com/'>Service Health Dashboard.</a></p>
<p>The dashboard is pretty standard fare - traffic lights to show availability for each Amazon service with a historical view available at the bottom.</p>
<p>This is good and all but where is the security dashboard?  I’d like to know their “security service” is operating normally.  Are they “hacker safe” ;-)</p>
<p>I can dream right?</p>
<p>Users of <a href='http://www.salesforce.com/'>salesforce.com</a> are not dreaming when they surf over to <a href='http://trust.salesforce.com/'>trust.salesforce.com</a>.  In addition to the - dare I say it - “expected” service availability dashboard, they display recent security alerts to raise awareness.</p>

<p>Thats definitely a “good thing” - as far as it goes.</p>
<p>For larger organisations that already use security metrics to track the effectiveness of their security program, this isn’t going to cut it.</p>
<p>Cloud providers, are you listening?</p>
<p>What security metrics would you expect to see from your cloud provider?</p>
