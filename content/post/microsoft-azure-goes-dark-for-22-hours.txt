<p>Forget concerns about <a href='http://cloudsecurity.org/2009/03/14/what-does-pci-compliance-in-the-cloud-really-mean/'>PCI</a> and <a href='http://cloudsecurity.org/2009/03/15/amazon-reserved-instances-always-read-the-label/'>DR in the Clouds</a> - Microsoft Azure just recovered from being offline for 22 hours.</p>
<p>The Azure Cloud is currently in Technology Preview mode which means unscheduled developer holidays are pre-baked in.</p>
<p>I haven’t written about Azure before (tut tut), however I have been following along.</p>
<p>In case you somehow missed the announcement from Ray Ozzie, this is the Azure Stack.</p>

<p>And this is what it looked like to the Azure development community for the past 22 hours:</p>

<p>As seems to be the case for Cloud outages, updates are posted to a support forum.  Here is all anyone knows thus far (via <a href='http://oakleafblog.blogspot.com/2009/03/azure-services-outage-3132009-brief.html'>Oakleaf Systems</a>):</p>
<p><img class='center' title='Azure Support Forum Outage Update' src='/files/OakLeaf_Systems__Azure_Services_Outage_3_13_2009_%E2%80%93_A_Brief_History-20090315-210308.jpg' height='558' alt='OakLeaf_Systems__Azure_Services_Outage_3_13_2009_%E2%80%93_A_Brief_History-20090315-210308 Microsoft Azure Goes Dark For 22 Hours' width='421'/></p>
<p>This was obviously a significant outage and it will be interesting to understand the root cause.  These massively distributed systems are truly an enormous engineering challenge - we’ll wait to see what Microsoft (and others) can learn from this particular incident.</p>
<p>I look forward to exploring the security aspects of Azure with you in the upcoming weeks.</p>
