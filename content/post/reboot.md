I started writing about cloud computing and security in 2008.  For about 3 years I experimented, blogged and presented on cloud security.  But soon after the posts dried up as real life moved on at a pace.  The cloud has come a long way since then and now there are many more practical use cases to explore and security know-how to share.  So it's time to dust off the digital cobwebs, polish the CSS and reboot this site.  


Welcome back!
