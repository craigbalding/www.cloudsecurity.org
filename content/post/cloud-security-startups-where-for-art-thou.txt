<p>Recently I asked <a href='http://cloudsecurity.org/2009/03/06/the-uitimate-cloud-security-challenge-spot-the-cloud-security-evangelist/'>‘Where are the Cloud Security Evangelists?’</a>.  <strong>Now I’m asking ‘Where are the Cloud Security startups?’</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ve had briefings and Q&amp;A sessions with a few but a recent email from a regular reader over at <a href='http://www.undertheradarblog.com/'>‘Under the Radar’</a>, prompted me to think “Yeah, where are they?”.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know are working at a <strong>pure-play Cloud Security or SaaS Securty startup</strong>, <a href='http://cloudsecurity.org/contact/'>I’d love to hear from you</a>.</p>
<p>First, I’m really curious what security challenge you are addressing.  Second, if you make it past<a href='http://www.undertheradarblog.com/nominate-to-present/'> this application form</a> and can get yourself over to San Francisco in April, <strong>you get to pitch your offering to a group of CIOs at ‘Under the Radar’</strong>.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, the prospect of meeting a room full of CIOs just doesn’t get me all that excited, however, <strong>you’ll get to meet CISCO Cloud pin-up </strong><a href='http://news.cnet.com/the-wisdom-of-clouds/'><strong>James Urquhart</strong></a><strong>!</strong></p>
<p>As its looking highly likely I will be declining my invitation (logistics, logistics), I’d like to make an offer to any security startup that gets accepted to pitch: <strong>I will give you up to 2 hours of my personal time (gratis) to grill you on your solution from an enterprise security perspective</strong>.  Let me find the security holes before the panel does :-).  If you think that might be valuable, <a href='http://cloudsecurity.org/contact'>reach out here</a>.</p>
<p>And just to be clear, no-one is paying me for this - I’m just very curious and a firm believer in good karma.</p>
