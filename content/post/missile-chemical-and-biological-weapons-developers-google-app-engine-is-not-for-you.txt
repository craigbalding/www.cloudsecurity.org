</a><br/>
Clause 2.2 just had some text added to it:</p>
<blockquote><p>“You agree not to use the Service in the design, development, production, or use of missiles or the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m glad they cleared that up - now all the bad guys know to use Amazon AWS or Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>P.S I can’t help feeling the irony, given the App Engine logo…</p>
