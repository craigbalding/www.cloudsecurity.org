<p><a href='http://www.undertheradar.com/'>Troy Angrignon</a> has put together a <a href='http://www.sandhill.com/opinion/daily_blog.php?id=64'>really useful Cloud Ecosystem Map</a>.</p>
<p>Why is this useful?  As he states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Following <span style='text-decoration: line-through;'>Terry Matthew’s</span> <a href='http://www.wesleyclover.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=13&Itemid=36'>Sir Terrence Matthews</a> “checkerboard model”, it should be easy going forward to <strong>f</strong><strong>ind logical areas that need to be built out</strong>. Think about it as “X for the cloud”. For example, identity management from the last era was mostly LAN/WAN-based single-sign on and directory service based. <strong>“Identity for the cloud” is a logical hole to fill</strong> and sure enough, that is what <a href='http://www.symplified.com/' target='_blank'>Symplified</a> is aiming to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>The map shows the companies along the X axis and the service offerings on the Y axis.</p>

<p>As you go through the map, do you spot any security opportunities?  I thought I’d see more security offerings listed but I don’t.  If that doesn’t scream ‘<a href='http://cloudsecurity.org/2009/03/11/cloud-security-startups-where-for-art-thou/'>gap in the market</a>‘ I don’t know what does!</p>
<p>Troy is looking for feedback - as he says, its version 1.0.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think in the comments.</p>
