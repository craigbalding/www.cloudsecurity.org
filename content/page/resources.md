Want to learn more about Cloud Computing? Or interested in reading more about the security of specific technologies? I read widely but here is the subset of sources I read regularly. This list will be updated occasionally.


**Useful sites**

[Cloud Security Alliance](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org) has a mission "To promote the use of best practices for providing security assurance within Cloud Computing, and provide education on the uses of Cloud Computing to help secure all other forms of computing".  Get expert [research](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/) for free, join a local [chapter](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/chapters/) and take part in their [events](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/events/).

[Rational Survivability](http://rationalsurvivability.com/blog) “Hoff’s Ramblings about Information Survivability, Information Centricity, Risk Management and Disruptive Innovation. Oh, I have a fondness for virtualization and cloud computing security, too…”. Chris is a truly smart individual with a diverse background, set of interests and amusing sense of humour (a personal favourite). Consequently, his blog is very popular!
